Cheat-Key is an Android app connected to a touch sensor and a servo motor through wi-fi. When the touch sensor is activated, the app returns Google’s voice command. It was for people with muscular dystrophy to easily access Google’s voice command. It also had another feature of accepting customizable voice commands to control servo motors. If these servo motors are attached to door hinges, one can open and close the door with voice commands. This feature may serve the “smart home” functionality with easier access for the disabled.

Used Cordova, Datadipity's web socket API and Bootstrap
